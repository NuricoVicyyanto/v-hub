This repository contains the code for the **V-hub** project. It is a web application designed to provide users with access to datasets and APIs through a user-friendly interface. The application is built using **React.js**, ensuring a dynamic and interactive experience for users.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Built with React.js and responsive libraries to ensure compatibility across all devices.
- **Data Access**: Allows users to browse and access various datasets and API resources.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Fetch and view data in real-time from different APIs integrated into the platform.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clear and intuitive interface for easy navigation and quick data access.
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly interact with external APIs to fetch and display data.
- **Search and Filter**: Built-in search and filter capabilities to easily find and explore datasets.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below to run it locally on your machine:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nuricovicyyanto/v-hub.git

    ```

5. Open the application in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once you've opened the project in your browser, you can interact with the dataset and API browsing system. Here are some of the key interactions:

- **Viewing Datasets**: Browse through available datasets and view detailed information.
- **Searching for Data**: Use the search bar to filter datasets by keywords or categories.
- **API Integration**: Connect with external APIs to fetch live data and view the results directly on the platform.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface and handling the application state.
- **Bootstrap**: For a responsive and modern design.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to external APIs and fetching datasets.
- **Node.js**: Used for running the local server during development.
- **React Router**: For navigation and routing between pages in the app.
- **jQuery**: (Optional) For handling dynamic elements, if applicable.
